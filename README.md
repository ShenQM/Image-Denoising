# Image-Denoising
Purpose: Implementing some classical or state of art image denoising algorithms with my understanding.  
Language: C++;  
Libs: Opencv 3.3.0(for io and some basic operations in images);  
Develop Environment: Visual Studio 2013;

## Demos
demos.h/demos.cpp: Demos code for these algorithms;  
test.h/test.cpp: some test in develop the source code(some test sample for verifying these functions, no relation   to the algorithms);  
common.h/comom.cpp: some functions maybe useful for different algorithms or data transforamtion;
